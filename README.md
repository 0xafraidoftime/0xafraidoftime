The ultrathink log update for February 5th 2026

We really gotta keep going, the only way is to keep going

A lil about me:

Hello stranger. I hope you're doing well. I am a full-stack software and ml engineer. I grew up in the States and now based in India. I enjoy anything to do with math, cs, algorithms, chess, psyche, nolan movies, hans zimmer soundtracks, video games (one of the recent ones), and game theory. Above all, I love humanity and doing anything and everything possible to help solve people's problems. Currently working on an XGBoost model using Supervised ML to detect cheaters on online chess platforms like chess.com and lichess.org. Also building YapbotAI to attend meetings on my behalf (because believe it or not I am still introverted as fuck and I am not afraid to admit that anymore ahahahahaha). Every board, every friend, every mentor, every opponent, and every tournament has shaped who i am today. I believe true wealth lies in the people you vouch for and the people who vouch for you. I enjoy chats with like-minded people and am always open to light-hearted, hilarious, and sometimes absolutely bizzare convos. Socials on the left panel, feel free to reach out to me on twitter, linkedin, or discord (i'm fairly active on all three, can't say that about the rest). Cheers and take care of yourself buddy. May the fourth be with ye o7.

P.S. my profile is ALWAYS under construction lmao. i'm in the perpetual pursuit of figuring myself out and pivoting endlessly. so don't be suprised if you visit again and see something completely different here

now in the words of the great kache master,
