ABOUT ME:

Hello stranger. I hope you're doing well today. I am a full-stack software and ml engineer. I grew up in the States and now based in India. I enjoy anything to do with math, cs, algorithms, chess, psyche, and game theory. Currently working on an XGBoost model using Supervised ML to detect cheaters on online chess platforms like chess.com and lichess.org. Also building YapbotAI to attend meetings on my behalf (because believe it or not I am still introverted as fuck and I am not afraid to admit that anymore ahahahahaha).
