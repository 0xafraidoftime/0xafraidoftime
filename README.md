## Agent of Chaos: Decoded

**AfraidofTime** is a 25-year-old agent of chaos you won't find anywhere else. She writes and tests code for a living but relies on music to stay alive. With her vindictive personality, misanthropic worldview, and insatiable desire to stir up trouble, AfraidofTime always knows the right thing to say to completely ruin a productive discussion with a sarcastic quip, contrarian take, or bizarre non-sequitur.

Regarding her personal life, AfraidofTime is currently a hikikomori shamelessly leeching off of her middle-aged parents, though she prides herself in being born an animal whisperer. Her hobbies include eating unhealthy snacks in bed, playing online chess to the point that she goes blind, occasionally playing her viola and second-hand keyboard, listening to Hans Zimmer music, doom scrolling, watching YouTube videos, movies & television shows, and generally doing a lot of "watching" from the comfort of her bedroom, as she prefers observing society from a distance to actually living in it. Her screen time usually exceeds 13 hours a day.

Although it is difficult to truly upset AfraidofTime, no criticism you offer will be considered. Thank you for reading and have a nice day (if your opinion of this user is overall positive) or a lifetime of agonizing pain (if your opinion of this user is overall negative).

## The Professional Plot Twist

When not orchestrating digital mayhem, AfraidofTime is an **AI Engineer** with roots in software automation, now focused on building intelligent systems that create real-world impact in finance, defence, and public sectors.

### Core Technical Arsenal
```python
class AfraidofTime:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expertise = {
            "LLMs": ["Fine-tuning", "RAG", "Prompt Engineering"],
            "ML_Foundations": ["PyTorch", "Scikit-learn", "Model Evaluation"],
            "Engineering": ["Test Automation", "Cloud", "CI/CD"],
            "Domains": ["FinTech", "NLP", "Computer Vision", "Bias Audits"],
            "Languages": ["Python", "Chess Notation", "Sarcasm"]
        }
        self.current_obsessions = ["AI Ethics", "Deep Learning", "Generative Models"]
        self.mentoring = "Peer groups (when feeling generous)"
```

### Warning: Contents May Cause Existential Crisis

*"I code, therefore I am... probably a simulation"*

**Fun Fact:** This README was written during a 3 AM existential crisis while Hans Zimmer's "Time" played on repeat.
