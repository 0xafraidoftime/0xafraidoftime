Hello stranger.

Full-stack + ML engineer.
Grew up in the U.S., now building from India.

I think in algorithms, endgames, and edge cases.
Math. CS. Game theory. Psyche. Chess culture forever.

Currently training an XGBoost model to flag chess cheaters (because patterns don’t lie, people do).
Also building YapbotAI to attend meetings for me. Yes, I’m still introverted as hell. Growth is non-linear.

3rd in India’s Women’s Chess Championship.
Student of every board I’ve ever lost on.

I believe reputation > currency.
The real wealth is who vouches for you.

Here for sharp ideas, chaotic humor, and conversations that start normal and end existential.

Socials are there.
Reach out if you think deeply or laugh easily.
